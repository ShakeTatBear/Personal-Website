# Personal-Website

This is a Node.js/React based personal website. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the website on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShakeTatBear/Personal-Website.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd Personal-Website
cd react-app

Install the necessary node modules:
npm install

To run the server, execute:
npm start

```
The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you have configured in your server.js file).
If not, please reach out to me at my email: joshalbrown@gmail.com


## Notes
- Emails.txt is still a placeholder before I can implement the database to the site (testing functionality of the request to get emails).
- Smooth Scrolling has been added and fixed.
- Dependencies are needed but included in the package.json
