# Personal-Website

This is a Node.js based personal website. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the website on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShakeTatBear/Personal-Website.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd Personal-Website

Install the necessary node modules:
npm install

To run the server, execute:
node server.js

The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port you have configured in your server.js file).

## Notes
- Emails.txt is a placeholder before I can implement the database to the site (testing functionality of the request to get emails).
- Some javascript is noticeably in the code of my html, this was much easier for me in some instances to do live edits on the spot.
- Although this page isn't multipage, I've left anchors on the page to direct the user to sections on the page. I thought this helped with the user experience.
- Two dependencies are needed but included in the package.json
- Likewise for navigation, I believe the nav bar/header will be much easier as soon as I change the existing code to move it across the page when navigating sections.
